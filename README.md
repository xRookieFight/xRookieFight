# 👋 Hello, I'm xRookieFight

I'm a software engineer and reverse engineer, passionate about building performant systems, scalable backend software, and developer-oriented infrastructure.
My work focuses on understanding how systems behave internally - then rebuilding them better, faster, and cleaner.

## 🚀 Open Source & Engineering

Over the years, I've been deeply involved in open-source development, contributing to projects used across the Minecraft: Bedrock server ecosystem and beyond. I enjoy working on complex codebases where performance, architecture, and long-term maintainability matter.

Projects I've contributed to or worked closely with include:

* **PowerNukkitX** - Feature-rich, highly customizable third-party server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.
* **AquaRelay** - Blazingly fast, lightweight, and easy to use Minecraft: Bedrock Edition proxy server written in PHP
* **bedrock-rs** - Universal library for Minecraft Bedrock in Rust

My main interests include API design, networking internals, and building systems that developers actually enjoy working with.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

I like solving problems at multiple layers:

* High-level architecture design
* Low-level performance optimization
* Protocol analysis and debugging
* Reverse engineering closed binaries to understand system behavior

Good software, to me, means **predictable performance, clean abstractions, and minimal complexity**.

## 💼 Experience

Most of my experience comes from developing and maintaining multiplayer server technologies and backend systems operating at scale.

Areas I've worked in:

* Multiplayer server architecture
* Network protocol handling
* Developer tooling & frameworks
* Performance debugging and optimization
* Infrastructure supporting high concurrent workloads

I'm currently exploring opportunities outside the traditional Minecraft space to apply these skills to broader engineering challenges.
